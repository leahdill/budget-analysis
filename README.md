# python-challenge

Our two challanges this week, PyBank and PyPoll, tasked us with writing scripts for provided csv files to yield simplified data that pushed to a new text file.

For PyBank, I found the net total profit over the range of months provided, as well as the average change over that time period, the month with the greatest jump in profits and the month with the greatest fall in profits. The script prints an analysis to GitBash, as well as pushes a text file to my analysis folder.

For PyPoll, I found the total number of votes that were cast in this election, and broke that down to a percentage of votes for each candidate as well as their total individual vote count. The winner is declared at the very end of the analysis. The script prints an analysis to GitBash, as well as pushes a text file ot my analysis folder.
